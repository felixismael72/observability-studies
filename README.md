## About this repository

This is a WIP project/study about an observability environment using elastic STACK.

Elastic STACK is a set of tools which includes: 
- elasticsearch (search engine/noSQL database);
- kibana (visualization console for information consumption);
- logstash (for log storage and handling);
- metricbeat (for measuring machine stats);
- heartbeat (for checking services availability);
- apm server (for measuring applications performance);
- etc.

Later, there will be some instructions to run this project. For now, it's under construction.

Some previous instructions:

- You need an .env file looking like this one to run the project: `./docker/.env.example`
